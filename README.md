Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was developed for a client named DriverPass, which is a company that wanted to provide an online platform for students to prepare for their driver's tests. The client wanted a system where the customers could schedule driving lessons with an instructor, take online practice tests, and see their progress. The system would make this functional for both the students and the instructors.

What did you do particularly well?
One area that I excelled in was defining and organizing the system's functional and nonfunctional requirements. I created UML diagrams, such as use case, activity, and class diagrams, which visualized the flow and build of the system. This presentation makes the goal clear and helps the development team build out the system because it provides a consistent reference point.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one of these documents, I would revise the System Design Document because I feel like I could have included more detail about the security side of the system as well as the data validation. I captured the user flow and major functions in the diagrams, but I didn't talk much about the security in the technical requirements section. There is a lot of security needed for a system that handles user authentication and payment information, so it is an important aspect of the project.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by listening to the client's requirements and identifying key user roles, like the students, instructors, and administrators. Once I identified those roles, I could build out functions that each one would need, which I could describe with user stories. These address the real world applications that the system would be used for.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software, I start by gathering the requirements and visualizing the system from the user's perspective. Then, I can create models that visualize the system's structure and behavior. In the future, I would like to implement more prototypes and user feedback sessions, so that I can build out proper functionality for the end user.
